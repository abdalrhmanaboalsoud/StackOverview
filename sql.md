## Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It enables users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, and managing data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

### History of SQL
SQL was developed in the early 1970s by IBM researchers, primarily Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce, as a part of their work on the System R database project. The language became the standard for relational database management and was adopted by ANSI in 1986 and ISO in 1987.

### Importance of SQL in Database Management
SQL is crucial for database management due to its ability to:
- Easily retrieve and manipulate data.
- Provide a consistent interface for users to access databases.
- Ensure data integrity and security through various controls and permissions.
- Support complex queries, transactions, and data analysis.

## Basic SQL Commands

### SELECT
The `SELECT` statement is used to query data from a database. It allows users to specify which columns to retrieve and from which table.

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
```

### INSERT
The `INSERT` statement adds new records to a table.

```
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, position) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Manager');
```

### UPDATE
The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing records in a table.

```
UPDATE employees SET position = 'Senior Manager' WHERE last_name = 'Doe';
```

### DELETE
The `DELETE` statement removes records from a table.

```
DELETE FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Doe';
```

## SQL Data Types

### Numeric
Numeric data types store numerical values, such as integers or decimal numbers.

- `INT`: Integer values.
- `FLOAT`: Floating-point values.
- `DECIMAL`: Exact numeric values with specified precision.

### String
String data types hold textual data.

- `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length character string.
- `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length character string.
- `TEXT`: Large text fields.

### Date and Time
These data types are used to store dates and times.

- `DATE`: Stores date values (YYYY-MM-DD).
- `TIME`: Stores time values (HH:MM).
- `DATETIME`: Stores both date and time values.

### Boolean
Boolean data types represent true/false values.

- `BOOLEAN`: Represents true (1) or false (0) values.

## Advanced SQL Commands

### JOINs
`JOIN` operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

#### INNER JOIN
Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.

```
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### LEFT JOIN
Retrieves all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.

```
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### RIGHT JOIN
Retrieves all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.

```
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### FULL JOIN
Retrieves records when there is a match in either left or right table.

```
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### UNION and UNION ALL
Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. `UNION` removes duplicate records, while `UNION ALL` includes all records.

```
SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT first_name FROM managers;
```

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query nested inside another SQL query. It can be used in `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.

```
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

### Indexes
Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of rows by creating pointers to data in a table. They improve query performance but can slow down data modification operations.

```
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees(last_name);
```

## SQL Functions

### Aggregate Functions
These functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single value.

- `COUNT()`: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
- `SUM()`: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
- `AVG()`: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
- `MAX()`: Returns the maximum value of a column.
- `MIN()`: Returns the minimum value of a column.

Example:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
```

### Scalar Functions
These functions operate on a single value and return a single value.

- `UCASE()`: Converts a string to uppercase.
- `LCASE()`: Converts a string to lowercase.
- `MID()`: Returns a substring from a string.
- `LEN()`: Returns the length of a string.
- `ROUND()`: Rounds a numeric field to the specified number of decimals.

Example:

```
SELECT UCASE(first_name) FROM employees;
```

### Date Functions
Date functions are used to manipulate date values.

- `NOW()`: Returns the current date and time.
- `CURDATE()`: Returns the current date.
- `DATEADD()`: Adds a specified interval to a date.
- `DATEDIFF()`: Returns the difference between two dates.

Example:

```
SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), hire_date) AS days_since_hired FROM employees;
```

## Database Design

### Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

#### 1NF (First Normal Form)
Ensures that each column contains atomic values and each row is unique.

#### 2NF (Second Normal Form)
Achieved when all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

#### 3NF (Third Normal Form)
Achieved when all the attributes are only dependent on the primary key.

#### BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
A stricter version of 3NF, where every determinant is a candidate key.

### ER Diagrams
Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are visual representations of the data model, showing entities, attributes, and relationships between them.

### Primary and Foreign Keys
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table, establishing a link between them.

## Transactions and Concurrency Control

### ACID Properties
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the key properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions.

### Transaction Control Commands
These commands manage transactions in a database.

#### COMMIT
Saves all changes made in the current transaction.

```
COMMIT;
```

#### ROLLBACK
Reverts changes made in the current transaction.

```
ROLLBACK;
```

#### SAVEPOINT
Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

```
SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
```

### Isolation Levels
Isolation levels define the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other concurrent transactions. Common isolation levels include:
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**
- **READ COMMITTED**
- **REPEATABLE READ**
- **SERIALIZABLE**

## Stored Procedures and Triggers

### Creating and Using Stored Procedures
Stored procedures are precompiled collections of SQL statements stored in the database. They can be executed as needed.

```
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
END;
```

### Creating and Using Triggers
Triggers are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a particular table.

```
CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_insert
AFTER INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, employee_id) VALUES ('insert', NEW.id);
END;
```

## SQL Performance Tuning

### Query Optimization
Query optimization involves modifying SQL queries to improve their performance.

### Index Optimization
Using indexes effectively can drastically improve query performance but should be managed to avoid excessive overhead.

### Analyzing Query Performance
Tools like `EXPLAIN` can help analyze and visualize how a query will be executed, allowing for better optimization.

```
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Doe';
```

## SQL Security

### User Management
Managing users involves creating and removing users and granting or revoking access to database resources.

```
CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

### Roles and Permissions

Roles are collections of permissions that can be assigned to users to simplify security management.

```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO 'new_user';
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

SQL injection is a common attack method where malicious SQL code is inserted into an entry field. Prevention techniques include:

- Using prepared statements.
- Validating and sanitizing user input.
- Employing ORM frameworks.

## Practical Examples and Exercises

- Write a query to find the top 3 highest-paid employees.
- Write a query to count the number of employees hired in the last 6 months.
- Write a query to retrieve the names and departments of employees with more than 5 years of experience.
- Optimize a query that retrieves the list of employees and their respective managers.
- Create a stored procedure to calculate the total salary expense of a department.
- Design a database schema for a library management system with entities like Books, Authors, Borrowers, and Loans.
- Write a trigger that logs any deletions made on the `employees` table.
